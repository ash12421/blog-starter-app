:pushpin: **Date: 12/12/24**  

I’m starting to believe my professors are engaged in some **twisted psychological experiment** to see how much **academic abuse** a student can take before they snap.  

**Exhibit A: Assignments.**  
Why do they assign **four essays, three problem sets, and a group project** in the same week—then act surprised when nobody turns them in on time? And let’s not even talk about group projects. You either carry the entire team or watch your grade burn because someone “forgot” to submit.  

**Exhibit B: The Lectures.**  
Three hours of a monotone voice reading off a PowerPoint. A **PowerPoint they copied from Wikipedia.** And they expect us to be engaged? Meanwhile, a **YouTube tutorial covers the same thing in ten minutes** with **actual clarity and real-world examples.**  

**Exhibit C: The Tuition Fees.**  
You’d think, for the money we’re paying, we’d get quality education. Nope. Instead, we get outdated materials, professors who barely show up, and **Wi-Fi that dies when more than ten people connect.**  

And the worst part? **They don't even care.** You ask a question, they say, **“Figure it out yourself.”** But if you don’t submit an assignment on time? **“That’s unacceptable.”**  

So yeah. **University isn’t about learning.** It’s about endurance. A slow grind of sleepless nights, useless assignments, and the realization that **you could have just self-taught everything for free.**
