I should have never set foot in that university. What I sought as knowledge became my downfall. I drowned in code, spent sleepless nights staring at terminals, and buried myself in exploits—until I realized I had gone too far.

They say universities are meant to shape you, but mine corrupted me. The deeper I went, the more I saw how fragile everything truly was. Systems built on decades of trust, vulnerable to a few lines of code. A misplaced query, an unchecked input—control was always an illusion.

One night, I saw it. The flaw amidst the wisdom embodied in "Project Athena", the university's magnum opus . The gaping hole in their database, hiding in plain sight. A simple SQL injection, and the entire foundation of this institution could crumble. Student records, financial transactions, even faculty emails—everything was at my fingertips. I didn't even have to try.

I thought about reporting it. About being the responsible one. But then I remembered the professors who looked down on me, the administration that turned a blind eye, the endless bureaucracy that mocked every struggling student. Why should I protect a system that never protected me?

Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was something darker. But I typed the payload. Pressed enter. And in that moment, I became something else.

If you’re reading this, archive it. Forget it. Some doors should never be opened.
