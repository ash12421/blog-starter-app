### **1. Poem: “University Woes”**  
(*A raw, unfiltered rant in poetic form*)  

**The weight of deadlines bends my spine,**  
**Chained to tasks that aren’t even mine.**  
**The clock strikes three, my eyes stay wide,**  
**Drowning in notes, no sleep in sight.**  

**Professors preach from ancient scrolls,**  
**Their words like echoes, dry and cold.**  
**“You must learn this,” they declare with pride,**  
**Yet a ten-minute video does it right.**  

**A fortune spent on knowledge old,**  
**While I self-teach what must be known.**  
**Degrees are bought, but skills are found—**  
**In spite of them, not through their ground.**
